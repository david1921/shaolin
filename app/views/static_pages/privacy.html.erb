	<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
	<p>What are cookies and how do we use them?</p>

	<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which your computer
	or mobile device downloads when you visit a website. When you return to websites –
	or visit other websites that use the same cookies – they recognise these cookies and
	therefore your browsing device.</p>

	<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how this website is being
	used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences,
	and generally improving your browsing experience.  Cookies can also help ensure
	marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

	<p>You can learn about the cookies we use and how to manage them below.</p>

	<h2>Managing cookies on this website</h2>
	<p>We use cookies on our website to make your browsing experience better. By using
	this website you accept our use of cookies.
	You can control how cookies are placed on your device and remove existing cookies;
	all you have to do is change your web browser settings.</p>

	<p>Please be aware that restricting cookies may affect the functionality of this
	website.</p>

	<h2>What types of cookies do we use?</h2>
	<p>The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into 1 of 4
	categories, based on the International Chamber of Commerce guide to cookie
	categories; Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality and Targeting.</p>

	<h2>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h2>
	<p>These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the website and use
	its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you've
	asked for can't be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you that is
	used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.</p>

	<h2>Performance Cookies</h2>
	<p>These cookies collect information about how you use a website, for example which
	pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages. These
	cookies don’t gather information that identifies you. All information these cookies
	collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how a website works.</p>

	<p>These cookies are not used to target you with online marketing. Without these
	cookies we can't learn how our website is performing and make relevant
	improvements that could better your browsing experience.</p>

	<h2>Functionality Cookies</h2>
	<p>These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user
	name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced
	features and content for you. For instance, a website may be able to provide you
	with local weather reports or traffic news. These cookies can also be used to
	remember changes you've made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you
	can customise. They may also be used to provide services you've asked for such
	as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect
	may be anonymous and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>

	<p>Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you've previously made
	or personalise your browsing experience.</p>

	<h2>Targeting Cookies</h2>
	<p>These cookies are used to tailor marketing to you and your interests.  They are also
	used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure
	the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited
	a website and this information may be shared with other organisations such as
	advertisers. Although these cookies can track your visits to other websites, they don’t
	usually know who you are.</p>

	<p>Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to
	you and your interests.</p>

	<h2>What happens to cookies that have been downloaded in the past?</h2>
	<p>Cookies set prior to you changing your settings may still be on your computer. You
	can remove them using your browser settings.</p>
