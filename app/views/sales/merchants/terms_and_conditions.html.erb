<h2>24. GENERAL</h2>
  <h3>24.1 <span>Further Assurance:</span> Each Party shall at the request and cost of
the other do or procure the doing of all such further acts, and execute or procure the valid execution of all such documents, as may from time to time be necessary in the requesting Party's reasonable opinion to give full effect to this Agreement and to vest in the requesting Party the full benefit of the assets, rights and benefits to be transferred to the requesting Party under this Agreement.</h3>
  <h3>24.2	<span>Waiver:</span> The rights and remedies of each Party under, or in connection with, this Agreement may be waived only by express written notice. Any waiver shall apply only in the instance, and for the purpose for which, it is given. No right or remedy under, or in connection with, this Agreement shall be precluded, waived or impaired by any failure to exercise or delay in exercising it, any single or partial exercise of it, any earlier waiver of it, whether in whole or in part, or any of the above in relation to any other right or remedy (be it of similar or different character).</h3>
  <h3>24.3	<span>Relationship of the Parties:</span> Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a trust, partnership, or joint venture or legal relationship of any other kind between the Parties that would impose liability upon one Party for the act or failure to act of the other Party. Save where expressly stated in this Agreement, neither Party shall have authority to make representations, act in the name or on behalf of, or otherwise to bind the other.</h3>
  <h3>24.4	<span>Severance:</span> If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect:</h3>
  	<p>24.4.1 it shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement; and</p>
  	<p>24.4.2	the Parties will use reasonable endeavours to negotiate in good faith with a view to replacing it with a valid and enforceable provision which achieves to the greatest extent possible the same effect as would have been achieved by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision but differing from the replaced provision as little as possible.
	If any illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision would be legal, valid or enforceable if some part of it were deleted, such provision shall apply with the minimum modification(s) necessary to make it legal, valid or enforceable.</p>
  <h3>24.5 <span>Remedies:</span> The rights and remedies arising under, or in connection with this Agreement are cumulative and, except where otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, do not exclude rights and remedies provided by law or otherwise.

  <h3>24.6 <span>Assignment and novation:</span> The Merchant shall not assign, novate or deal in any way with all or any part of the benefit of, or its rights or obligations under, this Agreement without the prior written consent of Barclays. Any purported assignment or transfer or other dealing which does not comply with the terms of this condition shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and, as between the Parties to this Agreement, be null and void.</h3>
  <h3>24.7 <span>Subcontracting:</span> The Merchant shall not sub-contract the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Barclays. If consent is given by Barclays pursuant to this condition, the Merchant shall be responsible for all acts and omissions of its sub-contractors as if they were its own.</h3>
  <h3>24.8 <span>Third Party Rights:</span> A person who is not Barclays or the Merchant shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 ("CRTPA") to enforce any term of this Agreement.

  <h3>24.11 <span>Entire Agreement:</span> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties in respect of its subject matter and supersedes any previous agreement between the Parties and relating to its subject matter. Each Party confirms that it has not relied upon, and (subject to condition 24.12) shall have no remedy in respect of, any agreement, warranty, statement, representation, understanding or undertaking made by any party (whether or not a party to this Agreement) unless that warranty, statement, representation, understanding or undertaking is expressly set out in this Agreement.</h3>
